## Introduction

Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. This project demonstrates how to implement multiple linear regression using Python and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
multiple_linear_regression/
│
├── .gitignore
├── Dockerfile
├── Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb
├── README.md
└── compose.yml
```

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration file for building the project environment.
- **Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for implementing and analyzing multiple linear regression.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration file for setting up the environment.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd multiple_linear_regression
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
